# Data Sharing Template Repository

This is a general template demonstrating the pattern recommended in the publication "Simple and Efficient Data Dissemination for Individual Labs" by the Payne lab at Brigham Young University. This repository can be downloaded as a template for data sharing and analysis.

## Publication
The template is currently in its initial stages.

## Repository contents
This repository contains all information, data and code necessary to replicate the analyses in the manuscript. The file names are intentionally self explanatory, but are briefly reviewed below.
